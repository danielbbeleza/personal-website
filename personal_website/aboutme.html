                <p>The human being by nature enjoys to stay in its comfort zone, and if there are 2 things that fascinates me about technology and self-development. First: we keep evolving our technology to make our lives easier and longer. And second: everytime someone has a crazy idea, there will be some guysthat will say: "It's impossible! You can't do it!"</p>
                <p>Previously, I helped to build the JUMIA Online Shopping app, where we were able to prove many people that e-commerce have a great potential in one of the poorest continents that exists, Africa.</p> 
                <p>It was at this time that I published my first article (<a href="https://proandroiddev.com/google-analytics-with-gtm-and-firebase-b4bdc80a0637" target="_blank">Google Analytics with Tag Manager + Firebase</a>) at a great Android Medium community that is ProAndroidDev.</p> 
                <p>Before taking the leap into the mobile apps world, I took a bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering, at "Universidade do Algarve". After having a small experience working in this field, I realized that it wouldn't fullfill me the way developing apps would.</p>
                <p>Today I keep growing as an Android Developer at Curve, one of the most exciting places to work that is based in London. As a startup I feel this is a lifetime opportunity to improve my technical skills and to work remotely (I know, I know... typical "millenial kid").</p>                
                <p>Outside of work, I like to read - some good self-improvement and classic novel books - video games and tv shows. I love dogs (all my life had at least one), greatly admire Japanese culture and I'm a huge football fan (the great S.L.Benfica).</p>
                <p>But I'm more than this...</p>
                <p>I can be sure of what I already know, but I’ve also the humility to learn from other people/sources, and from their perspective. I believe that there is nothing we can't do if we fight for it with all our strengths and will.</p>
                <p>It's really important to me to love what I do everyday. </p>
                <p>I often ask to myself "What if there was no money in the world? What would I like to do?" For almost 3 years, my answer has been the same: "I would create something awesome to help people improve their lives".</p>
